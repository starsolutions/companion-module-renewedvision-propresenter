# Companion Module for Renewed Vision's [ProPresenter](https://renewedvision.com/propresenter/)

See [HELP.md](https://github.com/greyshirtguy/companion-module-renewedvision-propresenter/blob/master/HELP.md) for instructions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (v2.5.4):
- Pro7 Windows - currentPresentation gives library path instead of playlist path!! This can affect some Pro7 Windows users when using new actions for slide by label and group slide. Need to determine a possible workaround as this will not be fixed upstream in Pro7 due to work on a new replacement API

## üìù Change Log:
### v2.5.4 (Companion Beta Build ???)
- Added MIDI listener to module enable Companion button press.
By default it is disabled - you need to enabled in module config.
It allows you to send MIDI (Note-On) messages from ProPresenter to Companipn (this module) and it will press a Companion button where the Note-On value => Index of Page and the Note-On Intensity => Index of Button to press

### v2.5.2 (Companion Build 2.2 RC?)
- (Update) Add module variables: time_since_last_clock_update and connection_timer (Can be used to monitor for connection issues)
- (Update) Naming update for WatchDogTimer (improve code clarity)
- (Update) Improved/extra debug logging (esp important for diagnosing user connection issues)
- (Bugfix) Stop emptying all current state when stage display connection drops (it only manages one var!)

### v2.5.1 (Companion Beta Build 3861)
- (New) Supports targeting multiple groups in 'Specific Slide In A Group' action.
- (New) New Action to generate a random number and store in module variable current_random_number.
- (Update) minor update to tooltip text in some actions
- (Update) Indexes in most actions support variable input.
- (BugFix) Force refresh with 'presentationCurrent' after first connection is authenticated (to ensure we alway have presentationPath)
- (Bugfix) Move self.updateVariable('current_presentation_path', String(objData.presentationPath)) to case 'presentationTriggerIndex':
- (BugFix) Added missing self.updateVariable('current_presentation_path', objData.presentationPath) in case 'presentationCurrent':
- (Bugfix) Bug fix for adding/subracting time to timer with negative value.
- (Bugfix) Group Slide bugfix (added missing foundSlide Check)

### v2.5.0 (Companion Beta Build 3822)
- Added this README.md
- (New) Updated config UI to make more user friendly.
- (New) Added config option to poll Looks to enable feedback of active look from Pro 7 on Windows - (Feedback already works for Pro7 on Mac without polling)
- (New) New action "Specific Slide With Label" - Trigger a slide by specifiying the playlist name, presentation name and the custom slide label that has been applied to the slide. Matches first playlist, presentation and slide label found. Finally you can trigger a slide in a presentation - no matter where it is moved to! (Also works with variables)
- (New) Added feedback for active Look
- (New) New action "Specific Slide In A Group" - Trigger a slide in a specified group name by index (eg 1st slide of "Chorus", 1st slide of "Bridge"). Can target the current presentation or a even specific presentation using a presentationPath. (Also works with variables!)
- (New) Added option for using either Name OR Index with many of the new Network link actions. If you you supply both an index and a name, the index will be used.
- (Update) Removed "- beta" label from Network link actions.
- (Bugfix) Minor bugfix with integer action parameters


### v2.4.6 (Companion Beta Build 3804)
- (New) Module variables to correctly track presentations that target announcement layer: 'Current Announcement slide number' & 'Current Announcement Presentation Path'
- (New) Config option to configure "Manual" Type of Presentation Info Requests that Pro7/Windows users can turn on to avoid performance issues when the option to "Send Presentation Info Requests To ProPresenter" is enabled.
- (New/Bugfix) New config option to configure "Manual" Type of Presentation Info Requests that Pro7/Windows users can turn on to avoid performance issues when the option to "Send Presentation Info Requests To ProPresenter" is enabled.
- (Bugfix) Incorrect values for current presentation path/slide/remaining slide when an annoucement presentation was running in background.
- (Bugfix) Pro6/Windows failed to update vars for (watched/all) clock

### v2.4.5 (Companion Beta Build 3803)
- (New) Added new variable for clock total seconds: 'pro7_clock_n_totalseconds' (where n = clock index) _This is good for feedback - eg change colour when countdown timer value is <0_
- (New) Allow + or - prefix to increment/decrement clockTimes (based on current value) in Update Clock action.
- (Bugfix) Fixed bug with hourless clock variables (was dropping negative sign for negative times)

### v2.4.4 (Companion Beta Build 3791)
- (Bugfix) Minor bugfix for two new beta actions (Clear Prop, Clear Message)

### v2.4.3 (Companion Beta Build 3785)
- (New) You can now use module or custom variables in the Message TokenValues Field in a send Message action

### v2.4.2 (Companion Beta Build 3766)
- (New) Allow hostname in config for ProPresenter
- (New) Add module var "current_presentation_path"
- (New) Full support for dynamically added module vars for all stage screens and clocks (now show in Ui and can be used in triggers etc).
- (New) Allow variables to be used in the "Specific Slide" action paremeters - This comes in handy if you store current_slide and current_present_path in custom vars and later use those custom vars as paremeters to recall the stored slide
- (New) Add follwing BETA actions using new Network Link API: 
    - Specific Slide (Network Link - Beta) - Trigger and slide by name
    - Prop Trigger (Network Link - Beta) - Trigger any Prop by name
    - Prop Clear (Network Link - Beta) - Clear any specific Prop by name
    - Message Clear (Network Link - Beta) - Clear any specifc Message by name
    - Trigger Media (Network Link - Beta) - Trigger any Media by name
    - Trigger Audio (Network Link - Beta) - Trigger any Audio by name
    - Trigger Video Input (Network Link - Beta) - Trigger any Video Input by name
    - Custom Action (Network Link - Beta) - Send custom JSON to custom Endpoint Path
- (Bugfix) Fixed issue with follower beta feature not properly tracking when disconnected and causing issues.

### v2.4.1 (Companion Beta Build 3693)
- (New) This version dynamically adds vars for all timers/clocks:
    - $(propresenter:pro7_clock_n) = hh:mm:ss for clock with index n
    - $(propresenter:pro7_clock_n_hourless) = mm:ss for clock with index n
    - (Still keeping old single var $(propresenter:watched_clock_current_time) for backwards compatibility in users setups)

### v2.4.0 (Companion Beta Build ????)
- (New) Pro7.6+ supports triggering macros and setting looks via the remote protocol. Added actions for triggering Looks/Macros!
- (New) Added module var for current_pro7_look_name

### v2.3.7 (Companion 2.1.4 Release Build)
- (New) Added a customAction - where you can type JSON message to send to ProPresenter (allows user to create new action before this mofule is updated - advanced use only - as ProPresenter is easy to crash with invalid messsages!)
- (Bugfix) Pro7.4.2 requires changes to API. Version must be at least 701 - or else connection is refused. Also: "presenationTriggerNext" (and Previous) must now include presentationDestination (which works fine with older versions of ProPresenter)

### v2.3.6 (Companion Beta Build ????)
- (New) Leader-Follower beta config option to mimic Pro6 Master-Slave setup.
